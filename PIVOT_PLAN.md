## 🚧 **Risks & Mitigation**

### **Risk 1: Restaurants Don't Sign Up**
**Mitigation:**
- Make it 100% free initially
- Do the setup work for them (you input menu, photos)
- Show value immediately (promote their events for free)
- Personal outreach, not cold emails

### **Risk 2: Users Don't Download**
**Mitigation:**
- Strong incentive (500 KES voucher)
- Campus activation where we demo the app in person
- Partner with influencers for credibility
- Solve real problem (finding events is currently hard)

### **Risk 3: Low Engagement/Retention**
**Mitigation:**
- Push notifications for events they'd like
- Weekly "This Weekend in Nairobi" roundup
- Gamification (points for trying new restaurants)
- Continuous feature improvements based on feedback

### **Risk 4: Competitors Copy Us**
**Mitigation:**
- Move fast (launch before they notice)
- Build relationships (restaurants are sticky)
- Focus on quality (better curation than competitors)
- Community building (users become advocates)

## 🎯 **When to Add Video Later**

**Don't add video until you have:**
- ✅ 5,000+ active users
- ✅ 50+ restaurants posting events regularly
- ✅ 10%+ booking conversion rate
- ✅ $2,000+/month in revenue
- ✅ $50,000+ funding for infrastructure

**Then add video as:**
- **GoEat Stories:** 24-hour restaurant/event highlights (like Instagram Stories)
- **Event Recaps:** User-generated content from events they attended
- **Dish Spotlights:** 15-second professional clips of signature dishes
- **NOT as:** Full TikTok clone (too expensive, too complex)

**Why wait:**
- Video hosting costs $500-2,000/month at scale
- Requires content moderation team
- Needs sophisticated algorithm
- Distracts from core value (discovery)
- Can add later once proven demand

---

## ✅ **Immediate Action Items**

### **This Week:**
1. **Freeze all video development** - Archive the code
2. **Simplify existing app** - Remove cart/checkout, focus on discovery + bookings
3. **Design event screens** - Sketch on paper first
4. **Create restaurant pitch deck** - 5 slides max
5. **Set up analytics** - GA4 and Mixpanel accounts

### **Next Week:**
1. **Build event system** - Backend models and API
2. **Reach out to 5 restaurants** - Schedule coffee meetings
3. **Create marketing materials** - Flyers, social media posts
4. **Recruit beta testers** - Find 20 people who'll test

### **Week 3:**
1. **Finish frontend** - Events screens and polishing
2. **Onboard first 10 restaurants** - Input their data yourself
3. **Beta test** - Fix critical bugs
4. **Plan launch event** - Book venue, invite people

---

## 🎬 **Final Recommendation**

**This pivot is exactly what you need.**

**Why:**
- ✅ **Simpler:** Can build in 3 weeks vs 6 months for video
- ✅ **Cheaper:** ~100K KES to launch vs 500K+ for video
- ✅ **Unique:** Events focus = clear differentiator
- ✅ **Testable:** Know in 30 days if it works
- ✅ **Monetizable:** Clear path to revenue

**Your New Elevator Pitch:**
*"GoEat helps Nairobians discover the best restaurants and food events happening right now. Stop scrolling Instagram for hours—everything's in one place."*

**Next Steps:**
1. Accept this pivot mentally (let go of video for now)
2. Create detailed task breakdown for Week 1
3. Schedule meetings with first 5 restaurants
4. Set launch date (aim for early January)
5. Start building immediately

**This can work. Launch fast, learn fast, iterate fast.**
